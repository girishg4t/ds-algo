//Given an array of distinct elements and a number x, find if there is a pair with product equal to x.

// Input: arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 4, 2}, K = 3
// Output: 1
// Explanation:
// There is only one pair (1, 3) with product = K = 3.

// Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 16, 4, 4}, K = 16
// Output: 2
// Explanation:
// There are two pairs (1, 16) and (4, 4) with product = K = 16. 

// Approch
//sort 
// take first multiply with 2nd check if equal to product else take 2nd and mutiply with 3rd
